audit.sh helper script for gw-aws-audit

Usage:
    audit.sh [gw-aws-audit commands]

Examples:
> This will run the 'gw-aws-audit sg detached' command for every region in the US (default)

    $ audit.sh sg detached

> This will run the 'gw-aws-audit ec2 stopped-hosts' for ONLY the us-west-2 region

    $ AWS_REGION=us-west-2 audit.sh ec2 stopped-hosts

> This will run the 'gw-aws-audit ec2 stopped-hosts' for every region in the EU

    $ REGION=eu audit.sh ec2 stopped-hosts

> This will run the 'gw-aws-audit cw monitoring' using a specific version of the tool.

    $ BIN_PATH=./bin/gw-aws-audit audit.sh cw monitoring

Note: REGION env values (default: US):
US: us-east-1 us-east-2 us-west-1 us-west-2
EU: eu-central-1 eu-west-1 eu-west-2 eu-west-3 eu-south-1 eu-north-1
AP: ap-east-1 ap-south-1 ap-northeast-3 ap-northeast-2 ap-southeast-1 ap-southeast-2 ap-northeast-1
CH: cn-north-1 cn-northwest-1

ALL: All of the above combined

You can also set AWS_REGION and that will supersede the value of REGION
